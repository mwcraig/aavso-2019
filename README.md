## Guide to CCD Data reduction with Python
### This is the item most ready for comments

The guide is at: https://mwcraig.github.io/ccd-as-book/00-00-Preface.html

The most straightforward way to provide feedback does not require you to run any of the code on your computer (though that is an option if you prefer it).

You will need a free account on GitHub.com to make comments, and you will need to log into GitHub.

Please go to the book at https://mwcraig.github.io/ccd-as-book/00-00-Preface.html

Below each section heading is a link that says "Click here to comment on this section in GitHub".

Clicking on any of those links as you read through the guide will take you to the location of that section on GitHub so that you can make comments.

To make a comment:

+ When you move your mouse over a line, a blue "plus" sign will be visible at the beginning of the line (if you are logged in to GitHub).
+ Click that blue plus and a box for making a comment will appear.
+ When you are done writing your comment, click either "Add single comment" or "Start a review".
+ If you click "Start a review" then you will need to complete the review by clicking on "Finish your review" in the upper right hand corner of the screen.

## Straightforward data reduction package

The package [reducer](https://github.com/mwcraig/reducer) presents a graphical interface to Python data reduction. To get started, [take a look at its documentation](https://reducer.rtfd.io).

## Photometry package for stellar photometry

Please sign up here to get an email in early December for testing the software: https://forms.gle/b4qxstUNCuw3ft1A9

If you want to try out the software in the [poster about TESS and VSX photometry](https://github.com/feder-observatory/aavso2019-poster) please click this button. It will open a browser windows in which you can try out the software: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/feder-observatory/aavso2019-poster/master?filepath=comparison_demo.ipynb)


Currently, the notebooks and underlying software are in two different places (which is why we recommend waiting a bit to try it out):

+ The Jupyter notebooks are [here](https://github.com/mwcraig/obs-astronomy-binder/tree/master/ORIGINALS-OF-USEFUL-NOTEBOOKS)
+ The underlying software is [here](https://github.com/glowing-waffle/glowing-waffles) (sorry about the package name ðŸ™„)
