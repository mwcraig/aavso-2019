## Guide to CCD Data reduction with Python
### This is the item most ready for comments

The guide is at: https://mwcraig.github.io/ccd-as-book/00-00-Preface.html

The most straightforward way to provide feedback does not require you to run any of the code on your computer (though that is an option if you prefer it).

You will need a free account on GitHub.com to make comments, and you will need to log into GitHub.

Please go to the book at https://mwcraig.github.io/ccd-as-book/00-00-Preface.html

Below each section heading is a link that says "Click here to comment on this section in GitHub".

Clicking on any of those links as you read through the guide will take you to the location of that section on GitHub so that you can make comments.

To make a comment:

+ When you move your mouse over a line, a blue "plus" sign will be visible at the beginning of the line (if you are logged in to GitHub).
+ Click that blue plus and a box for making a comment will appear.
+ When you are done writing your comment, click either "Add single comment" or "Start a review".
+ If you click "Start a review" then you will need to complete the review by clicking on "Finish your review" in the upper right hand corner of the screen.
